# Telemed_flaskProject
 
Abstract

Our Telemedicine application is a web and mobile application enabling contactless doctor visits through voice and video conferencing. The application aims to provide safe medical diagnoses through voice and video conferencing with a licensed physician. The voice conferencing feature allows users the privacy they may need in order to have a successful consultation. Users may schedule an appointment with a physician, as well as filter physicians according to those within their health care provider’s network. After each visit, users will be able to pay their copay through the application as well, meaning that it must be a safe and secure system for privacy protection purposes. Users may also view past visits, while doctors will be able to send off their prescriptions to the pharmacy of the patient’s choice as well.
